# Signup Screen

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a clean and modern signup interface I built with Flutter. Just a simple screen to handle user registration with some cool features.

## What's Inside

- validation (email, username, password)
- Password strength checking
- Cool password visibility toggle
- Social login options (Google, Facebook, Twitter) (Ui Only)
- Custom styled buttons and text fields
- Success dialog Leads to Home Screen
