# Shopping App Interface

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a simple shopping app UI I built with Flutter. Nothing fancy, just a clean interface to display products and offers.

## What's Inside

- Product carousel at the top
- Grid view of products (2 columns)
- Horizontal scrolling hot offers section
- Add to cart functionality with feedback
